Elaina: 
-I added a potions function where players could heal themselves before attacking. The player starts with 10 potions and each potion would heal one fourth of the player's max HP. 
-The amount of potions is an instance variable in the Character and the healing is an abstract method in the Character class. The heal method wouldn't let the HP of the character to be over the original HP, so if it does, then it would just be the original HP. In the driver file, the choice to heal would be before the attack and after the amount of HP is shown. It would ask the player if they wanted to heal or not. 1 is nay and 2 is aye.
